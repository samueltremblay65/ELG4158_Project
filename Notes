Under conditions where Q and R are in fact constant, both the estimation error
covariance and the Kalman gain will stabilize quickly and then remain constant. If
this is the case, these parameters can be pre-computed by either running the filter off-line,
or for example by determining the steady-state value of as described in (Grewal and
Andrews 2001).
